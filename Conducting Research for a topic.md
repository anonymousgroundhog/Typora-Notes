# Conducting Research 

## Initial Steps (Answer the following questions)

1. **What is the conceptual underpinning?** What are you trying to find out, conceptually? (What concepts or
   theories underlie your idea?)

   I am trying to find out whether …

   

2. **Why is it important?** Why is an answer important and to whom? (Who will care about your answer and
   why should they care?)

   It is important to find out because …

   

3. **What research approach will you use?** How will you find the answer, operationally? (What research
   method and data will you use to find the answer?)

​		I will find out by …



## Then do the Topic Analysis

The topic analysis is, essentially, a simplified proposal, providing a rough outline of factors relating to the research. The topic analysis should be quite short: 2 to 4 pages should be sufficient in most cases. A short, concise description is needed at this juncture. A few comments about each section may help in preparing this type of analysis. 

1. ##### **Problem Statement, Hypothesis or Question** 

2. 1. This relates to what the dissertation will deal with. If hypotheses are appropriate, they should be stated. If the type of topic is not amenable to the statement as a hypothesis, then a research question that underlies the problem should be clearly stated. 

3. ##### **Importance of the Research** 

4. 1. This addresses the question of whether or not the research is important or significant enough to justify doing it. If there is some statement by a prominent researcher or authority as to a need for this research, or if it can be demonstrated that this research is significant to a major activity, then this or related reasons should be concisely stated in a short paragraph. 

5. ##### **Significant Prior Research** 

6. 1. This part essentially mentions the major preceding research. This need not be exhaustive when topics are being selected but the student should make a quick investigation taking perhaps one or two full days to look at the major research works on the topic and, if applicable, the relation of the topic to prior work. 

7. ##### **The Possible Research Approach or Methodology** 

8. 1. This section of the topic analysis is extremely important because it outlines how the student proposes to approach the research itself. Alternative methodologies should be included and their usefulness or lack of usefulness briefly discussed. 

9. ##### **The Potential Outcomes and the Importance** 

10. 1. The contents of this section are vital to an assessment of the dissertation proposal. For each research approach, the different but possible outcomes should be described.

## The importance of the Introduction of the paper

When you start writing, focus on the introduction of the paper and focus on why the topic is important

1. **What type of hook was used to generate interest in the paper?**

2. 1. Provocative quotation
   2. Highlights trends on Main Street or Ivory Tower

3. **What does paper address that other papers have not addressed?**

4. 1. Establishing the field: Continues ongoing discussion of the field foundations
   2. Problematizing the field: More knowledge is needed, and this paper will provide it

5. **Framing the contribution What did we learn and how does this improve the world?**

6. 1. Consensus shifting: Identifies widely assumed assumptions and challenge them
   2. Consensus Creation: Clarifies where there has been a debate or resolve conflict



## Preparing to Submit a Research Paper

**Adapted from several sources by** [**GL Sanders**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eQmi8yEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)

Writing is hard. For most people it takes years of work to become a solid writer. Here are some strategies you can use to improve your writing that are gentle on the ego. One of the key aspects of the approach is the use of the self-critique template. The writer submits his or her paper with the self-critique to the faculty member and the faculty member gives you feedback primarily on the self-critique. 

1. **Just start writing.** Get one or two pages down. Most people are good for maybe 4 pages per day. Write some paragraphs with your eyes shut. It will be hard to read, but it helps you focus. Don’t worry about editing at this point.
2. **Ideally wait one day till the next phase.** If you cannot wait till tomorrow, then exercise for at least ½ hour. Your brain will reorganize and provide insight into the writing task 
3. **Edit your pages by reading them out loud.**
4. **Edit your page using a grammar checker.** Don’t worry too much about passive voice recommendations, but do try to implement most of the recommendations.
5. **Mapping the territory and expand.** Some people are more effective when using an outline or some type of network diagram to add structure to your writing. Expand on your pages by filling in the blanks for the outline or the network diagram.
6. **Have 2 more eyes look at your paper.** Have a faculty member, a friend, family, read your work and provide feedback on content and grammar. 
7. **Edit your pages one more time by reading them out loud.**
8. **Turn in your final paper.**

**General Suggestions**



- **Write in the morning if possible (applies to many people).** They are usually the golden hours for productivity**.** 
- **Sleep and exercise.** They help you solve difficult problems and reorganize memory.
- **Edit** your paper three to five times. That means each page should be **edited 3-5 times**. Have someone else (student, friend or family) read your paper **at least once**. 
- **Search.** There is evidence that you need from 7-11 sources to generate innovative ideas**.** If you are doing a research paper, then consult library references, conference proceedings, the internet and carbon-based life- forms about the area of interest.
- **Read** the [Style Points for Scientific Writing](https://psych.uw.edu/undergraduate/writing-center/writing-guides) before rewriting the paper. It is from the University of Washington’s [Psychology Writing Center](https://psych.uw.edu/undergraduate/writing-center).
